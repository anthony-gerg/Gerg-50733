The following package contains the following files:

Homework6.py: This is the main file that should be run for the Homework. The output of this file when ran should be FIVE different
figures showing off three different working methodologies. The first two figures will be showing off the pendulum equation from Homework 3
but with different initial conditions, with an interesting curve for both. The third figure will be showing off central difference. This figure will
Have two different plots. A scatter plot showing off the central difference and a red line plot showing the actual derivative of the function being
fitted. The final two plots are showing off a general Runge-Kutta for an ODE. This is showing a weird ODE, but with some compartmentalization. It's ugly,
but it returns values. Sorry I couldn't come up with a more interesting equation!

Package: In the package folder is my different files I am referencing, outlined below

__init__.py: My initializaiton for my package, nothing crazy and it is empty

central_diff.py: My python file containing my method for central difference

fitting.py: My python file containing my Runge-Kutta function for ODE

pendulum_notebook.py: My python file containing my Runge-Kutta function for pendulum specific equation.

__pycache__: This showed up after running all my functions, I think it is internalizing my fucntions in each files so that they can be used later. Or,
who knows, maybe I'm talking out my ass here. I haven't done much research into them and I canno tread them due to the files being .pyc. 

TO RUN:
From CommandShell, simply use whatever method your operating system uses to run the Homework6.py script, and the plot should pop up. It is rather large, so
be warned. It has worked for me when sending it to my Linux machine so I'm sure it will run for Mac. If issues are run into you can email me.
